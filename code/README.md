# Crowd counting

## Description
Project in which we designed an algorithm, based on classical computer vision, to count the people in images of a beach.

## Environment

*Pre-requisites:*
* You must have installed Miniconda or Anaconda.

*Steps:*
1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute `conda env create -f env.yml`.
3. Execute `conda activate image-video-env`.

## Usage
You can open the notebook `header_counter.ipynb`, select the appropiate kernel (image-video-env) and run it.

## Structure
Here the structure of the project is explained.

*Folders:*
* images: contains the images used to test the algorithm.
* intermediate_results: contains the intermediate results of the algorithm.
* lib: contains auxiliar python files and functions created to help the development of the algorithm.
* methods: contains the methods used to count the people in the images.
* results: contains the final results of the algorithm.
